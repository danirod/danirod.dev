      I offer a different range of services related to development, including
      working on complete projects from their inception until deployment, or the
      maintenance of existing codebases. I can also provide training services to
      help individuals or teams gain skills in different areas of the software
      development process.

          Whether it is a site or a blog to promote your business, an e-commerce
          to let users purchase right from your site, or a complete web
          application for your online SaaS startup, I can help you build your
          ideas, either from the design to the go-live, maintaining your
          existing codebase or backing your team as a short-term or long-term
          contractor.
        </p>
        <p>
          I provide support both for backend and frontend development, which
          means that all the areas of your website are covered.

        <p>
          Progressive Web Applications use the web as a platform but they
          imitate normal apps. With features like a home screen shortcut,
          fullscreen mode or notifications, your users won't notice that they
          are just actually using a website.
        </p>
        <p>
          PWAs have some advantages like not needing costly platforms, waiting
          for approvals on app stores or hoping your users update the app. Just
          ask the user to press a button, and the application will be there for
          your customers.
