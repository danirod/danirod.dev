      <summary>How much do your services cost?</summary>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, the answer is it depends. It is not possible to just
        throw a price tag, because there are many price ranges. Software and web
        development requires some analysis and planning, as different projects
        have different complexities and that implies different time and effort
        estimations, which ultimately affect the total cost of a project.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, a small website project (such as designing and publishing a
        small WordPress website) can cost between $1000 and $2500 depending on
        the requirements and the size of the site, maintenance not included.
        However, this is just an example. The only way to know the final price
        for a project would be to get in touch so that I can plan a budget, no
        obligations attached.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hourly rates can also cost between $40 and $100 depending on the needs
        and if I am applying any discounts. I usually discount my rates when
        bundling time in advance. For instance, for a full day of work or if you
        book an entire week of my time I can lower the price since it is also
        making me easier to manage my schedule. Again, get in touch with me if
        you have an idea for something so that I can provide you a quote for
        free.
      </p>

    <details>
      <summary>Do you rate by project or by hour / day / week?</summary>
      <p>
        Again, it depends. I prefer setting up hourly, daily, weekly or even
        monthly rates, because this allows you to only pay for the job that is
        actually done: you only pay for time I spent working on your project,
        either design, creating the software or website, or communications and
        support.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, for some projects it makes more sense to budget the full
        project at once and have it split in two or three installments.
        Installments are configured at the beginning and end of project, and at
        other important milestones. This provides expectations and safety about
        the provided services both for you and for me.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once again, the only way to know what tailors best to your kind of
        project is to contact me so that I can advise about the options once I
        know about your project needs, no strings attached.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Will we have to sign an agreement or contract?</summary>
      <p>
        Yes, that is expected. I don't work without prior agreement, as signing
        some kind of document is the only way both you and me can be clear in
        regards to project expectations, third party intellectual property
        access, milestones and payments.
      </p>
      <p>
        I try to keep the paperwork simple because I am not good at these
        things. At the very least, I provide a basic agreement with clauses and
        conditions both for me as an independent developer and you as the
        customer of my services that are standard in our industry, as well as
        clauses based on things I've seen during the time I've been a freelance.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, many projects will require a specific agreement. The agreement
        tries to be fair to both parts, it will reflect that it is expected for
        me to deliver in a professional way, while at the same time making sure
        that the client will not try to cheat on the project development during
        our business relationship. You're guaranteed to have time to review and
        accept the agreement before the work starts, no strings attached until
        signature, and of course, at no cost.
      </p>

    <details>
      <summary>My project already exists, can you work on my codebase?</summary>
      <p>
        Of course I can. Say for example that you are already building something
        and you need more labour working on it, or that you inherited a codebase
        and you don't know what to do with it. Maybe you already got a webpage a
        couple of years ago but you can't or don't want to have the original
        team updating it.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this case, I can provide services such as adding new features,
        maintaining the application to fix bugs or to keep it online and
        working, or updating the application in case it stops working properly
        under new hardware, browsers or operating systems. Contact me explaining
        your needs and I'll give you more information about how can I help you.
      </p>

      <summary>Are you available as a contractor developer?</summary>
      <p>
        Yes, I can join your team as an external member, also known as a
        contractor. For example, if you need to back a team member that is in a
        leave or if you have a spike of work in your company and you need more
        hands working in the team but you already know the tide will go out and
        you will need to downscale your team in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
        For rookie recruiters: remember to check the definition of freelance
        developer. No, I will not join your company or your customer's company
        as a full time employee. I am self-employed and I provide development
        services to different professionals and organizations. While I am
        describing here working for companies, it is an independent relationship
        between the company and me.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are a CTO or a more technical person and your project has
        technical requirements that need to be checked (such as whether I have
        experience with your software stack), contact me so that I can provide
        more information about that.
      </p>

      <summary>Do you offer maintenance contracts?</summary>
      <p>
        If you want a maintenance contract, it can be added to your project and
        billed separately. I do not enforce them by default -once the project is
        finished, I consider it closed. However, planning software is difficult
        and sometimes it is desirable to keep a hotline for new features or
        fixing bugs that may arise during the lifetime of the application.
      </p>
      <p>
        In those cases, keeping a maintenance contract is useful as it allows
        you to keep a emergency line to address issues that may arise, provide
        support for the application, or plan new features or changes that may be
        required depending on your needs, even after the project is supposedly
        finished.
