      I offer a different range of services related to development, including
      working on complete projects from their inception until deployment, or the
      maintenance of existing codebases. I can also provide training services to
      help individuals or teams gain skills in different areas of the software
      development process.

          Whether it is a frontpage or a blog to promote your business, an
          e-commerce to let users purchase right from your site, or a complete
          web application for your online product, I can help you build your
          ideas, either from design to go-live, maintaining your existing
          codebase or backing your team as a temporal or long-term contractor.
        </p>
        <p>
          I can provide support both for backend and frontend development, which
          means that all the areas of your website are covered.

        <p>
          Progressive Web Applications use the web as a platform but closely
          imitate applications. With features like a home screen icon on mobile
          phones, a fullscreen mode or notifications, your users won't notice
          that they are just actually using a website.
        </p>
        <p>
          Progressive Web Applications have several advantages like not needing
          to use expensive or costly mobile platforms or wait long times for
          reviews and approvals on app stores. Just ask the user to press a
          button, and the application will be there for your users to enjoy.
